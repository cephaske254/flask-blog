## Post Installation Setup (**IMPORTANT !**)
After creating a user, the default role of the particular user is **'user'** hence they doesnt have full rights to manage the blog. First login to the newly created account. To gain admin rights, you have to edit the url manually to /admin e.g. localhost:5000/admin. (Also applies to Heroku)
This step is only done once! An admin User has a different expierience if compared with a User. You might have to create another account if you want to login as a user.
